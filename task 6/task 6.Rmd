## TASK : Prediction Using Decison Tree Algorithim
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading the Dataset
```{r}
dt <- iris
head(dt)
dim(dt)
```
## Basic Data insight
```{r}
sum(is.na(dt))

```
There is no null value in the data set 
# Creating sample train and test Data set
```{r}
s <- sample(200,150)
train <- dt[s,]
test <- dt[-s,]
dim(train)
dim(test)
```
## Loading the library for decison tree data
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
```
# We will be predicting the classification of Species here utlising all the variable by the model
```{r}
model <- rpart(Species~., train, method = "class")

rpart.plot(model)
```
We can now feed any new/test data to this classifer and it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
